This is my implementation of the [Barnes-Hut algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) in 2D for an N-body gravity simulator. The 2D Barnes-Hut algorithm uses a quad-tree to provide a fast approximation for particle interactions.

I've implemented this in [Processing](http://processing.org/), with the [controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) UI library.

There is a brief video demo on YouTube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbcp_sUtx7w).
